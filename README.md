based on papers http://www.cse.chalmers.se/alumni/markus/LangClass/LangClass.pdf


This a simple Naive Base classifier .Input is different Document representing different languages .

Hadoop is used to calculate the chi square test on different features and to calculate the P(C) probability of any class and P(X| C) conditional probabbility of a feature given class C.

These data is then saved in database to predict output later.


Project is right now raw will be ready soon....
